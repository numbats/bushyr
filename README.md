# bushyr
The tools for monitoring, tracking and predicting bushfire risk across Victoria

# Plan

- Develop web app (based on [VICfire app](https://ebsmonash.shinyapps.io/VICfire/) to provide risk predictions for geographc regions across Victoria. Users can enter weather conditions, additional variables, and obtain estimation of risk, and associated uncertainty. 
    - Clean up and understand code of current VICfires app
    - Develop the simulation routines to predict fire risk for grid cells across the state
    - Add data entry options to allow user to enter values for selected variables
    - Provide elegant reporting of risk and uncertainty, including tables and plots
- Inspire other open data and open access tools to alleviate bushfire damage in Australia, especially the ecosystem and wildlife

# Reading materials

- grant proposal
- Patrick's Honours thesis, containing data collection and combination for modeling bushfire cause
- VICfire code, and current functionality
